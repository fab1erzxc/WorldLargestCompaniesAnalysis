# WorldLargestCompaniesAnalysis

In this project I scrape the data about World Largest Companies By Revenue using Python libraries such as Requests and BeautifulSoup4, and then I write this data to a Pandas dataframe, and then I write it into a CSV file. After that I open up up that CSV file in a different file as a Pandas DataFrame to do i little analysis.
